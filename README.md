# Studyhub
This is a project for keeping different exam paper answers for maths and computer science done and in one place.
The point of this is that everyone learns the same thing, but in this day and age we need to keep up with tech especially.
With this in mind, this will hopefully provide enough content for learning so that student in MU especially will be able to learn their own things with the time saved in studying, and possibly the curuculum can be updated to teach more to the students and provide a more inteligent student.
